“03_feature_selection_mc_simulation” demonstrates how I implemented feature engineering, such as, forward selection method to select optimal linear regression models and used Monte Carlo simulation to cross validate a set of classifiers to get robust predictions
      <ul> 
       <li>Implemented parallel computing to increase efficiency of forward selection using utilizing multiple CPU cores</li>
	   <li>Expanded explanatory variable by creating lagged terms, quadratic terms and seasonal effects</li>
       <li>Applied forward selection to select optimal set of explanatory variables for linear regression model</li>
       <li>Performed PCA to solve multicollinearity issue in explanatory variables and applied forward selection to select optimal set of PC variables for linear regression model</li>
       <li>Used Monte Carlo simulations to cross validate two different regression models and performed prediction with robust models</li>
      </ul>
